# Shelvd 2.0

Shelvd (2.0) is a redesign of my original Ruby on Rails project, Shelvd. I created the original Shelvd before I knew any Javascript, so while it does contain interesting and useful functionality (authentication, book searching, chat rooms, etc), it's a bit clunky in terms of UX/UI. That's why I've decided to remake it using React. I plan to morph some of the functionality a bit, but the core spirit of it being a book tracking application remains. Shelvd is currently in progress and not deployed at the moment.

The second purpose of this project is to build a React application using hooks rather than relying on class components for component state management. I am using Redux for global state management and Node.js (Express) for the [backend](https://github.com/alliecaton/shelvd-react-backend)
